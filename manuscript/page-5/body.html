        <p class="beginning"> Donald Trump has the kingly Leo Ascendant, meaning he is determined, elusive and almost always right.</em> His Ascendant Lord Sun is placed with an exalted Rahu in his 10th house of career, giving rise to his deep obsession for position of authority and territorial. </p>

        <p> In his chart, Mars is strongly placed giving him an administrative ability to face any challenge easily. It also signifies that he is bullish and has an intimidating personality. In his mind, Donald is convinced that he is always right, and he usually <em>will</em> be on most issues during his tenure. </p>

        <p>Over all, Donald is ruled by the fire element, the planet Sun. He will work aggressively, think fast and is somewhat poised to make history with the help of Mercury being a lord of wish fulfilment house. </p>
