        <h1> World Affairs </h1>
        <p> Period between 26<sup>th</sup> January ’17 to 23<sup>rd</sup> January ’20 is under transitive influence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> phase of <em>Sade Satti Shani</em>. During this transit of Saturn from the Sagittarius, Donald's position on international trade, wars and foreign policy is expected to change radically, and sometimes in stark contrast to his own assumptions earlier. 

        <p> For example, counter to popular belief it is likely that Trump will pull out from areas of conflict rather quickly even as he advances investments in military space and armed forces.</p>

        <p>Saturn is Vargottam planet in his chart, meaning he will be able to win over opposition from his political adversaries easily. Saturn may affect his personal health. Overall, a calming influence on the world is expected. </p>
