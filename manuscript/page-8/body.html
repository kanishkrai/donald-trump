        <h1> World Affairs </h1>
        <p> Period between 26<sup>th</sup> Jan ’17 to 23<sup>rd</sup> Jan ’20 is under transitive influence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> phase of <em>Sade Satti Shani</em>. During this transit of Saturn from the Sagittarius, Donald's position on international trade, wars and foreign policy is expected to change radically, sometimes even in stark contrast to his own assumptions made earlier. 

        <p> For example, counter to popular belief it can be expected that Trump will pull out from areas of conflicts rather quickly even with more investments into military research and armed forces.</p>

        <p>Saturn is Vargottam planet in his chart, meaning he will be able to win over opposition both internally (self-doubt) and outside from his political adversaries. Saturn may affect his personal health. Overall, a calming influence on the world is expected. </p>
