        <h1> World Affairs </h1>
        <p> Period between 26<sup>th</sup> January ’17 to 23<sup>rd</sup> January ’20 is under transitive influence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> phase of <em>Sade Satti Shani</em>. During this transit of Saturn from the Sagittarius, Donald's position on international trade, wars and foreign policy is expected to change radically, sometimes even in stark contrast to his own assumptions made earlier. 

        <p> For example, counter to popular opinion it is more likely that Trump will withdraw from areas of conflicts and wars rather quickly. Even as investments in military research and armed forces go up. Saturn is Vargottam planet in his chart, meaning he will be able to win over opposition both within (self-doubt) and from his political adversaries easily. Saturn may affect his personal health though. </p>
