        <h1> World Affairs </h1>
        <p> During the 3<sup>rd</sup> phase of Saturn's transition (<em>Sade Sati Shani</em> ~ 26<sup>th</sup> January '17 to 23<sup>rd</sup> January '20) there will be a major shift in policies all over the world. During this transit of Saturn from the Sagittarius, Donald's position on international trade, war and policies are expected to change radically, sometimes even in stark contrast to hiw own assumptions.</p>

        <p>Saturn is Vargottam planet in his chart, meaning he will be able to win over opposition both internal within himself and political from his adversaries outside. The negative effect of Saturn will almost certainly be on his health. Overall world affairs are expected to heat up during Donald's presidency even as wars and unrest will come down. This is despite more investments into miltary research. </p>
