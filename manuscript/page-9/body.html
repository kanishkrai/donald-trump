      <p>Scorpio is a secretive sign, so very few will truly know the mind of Donald Trump. He will say and do whatever he thinks is necessary to get his way in life, and makes life miserable for anyone who dares to get in his way.</p>
      <p> He is not a soft-hearted guy. It means he wonâ€™t reveal his inner feelings and character, but his emotions most definitely shall always affect the decisions he makes.
