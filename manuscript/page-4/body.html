        <h1> Synopsis </h1>
        <p class="beginning"> Donald Trump has kingly Leo Ascendant. His
            Ascendant Lord Sun is in close conjunction with an exalted Rahu in 
            his 10th house of occupation, status, reputation, and career, giving 
            rise to his deep-rooted obsession for position of authority. </p>
        <p> In his chart, Mars is strongly placed giving him tremendous administrative 
            ability and 
            <em> courage </em> to face any challenge easily. It also signifies that 
            he is bullish and has an intimidating personality. 
            In his mind, he is convinced that he is always right and usually <em>is </em> about almost everything.</p>
