        <p class="beginning"> Jupiter main and sub-period started from 14th November '16 and will continue up until 3rd January '19 — a period of great successes and impact with the lord of creativity and <em> purva punya </em> (karma of last births) lending him innovative ways to deal with issues house. </p> 

        <p>An auspicious <em>Akhand Samrajaya Rajyoga</em> in his charts will help him form a closely trusted and capable cabinet. In Donald’s Ascendant chart, Sun is in good strength and in Navamsa chart it is placed in public house indicating that he will have magnetic influence on people with his oratory skills. </p> 

        <p> The transitioning over birth Jupiter from Ascendant signature indicates aspects of actions house, meaning he will start his presidency in the sub-sub period of Jupiter phase and take quick actions. </p>
